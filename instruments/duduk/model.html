<h2> Physical model </h2>

Reed opening \(h\), mouth pressure \(p_m\), downsrteam pressure \(p\) and the flow through the reed \(u\).

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:model}
	\begin{cases}
		\ddot{h}+\frac{\omega_r}{Q_r} \dot{h} + \omega^2_r(h-H) = -(p_m-p) \frac{K}{\omega_r^2} \\
		\hat{p}(\omega) = Z(\omega) \hat{u}(\omega) \\
		u = w h^+ \mathrm{sgn}(p_m-p)\sqrt{\frac{2|p_m-p|}{\rho}}
	\end{cases}
\end{equation}

First equation: reed as a one degree of freedom oscillator, with \(H\) the reed opening at rest, \(Q_r\) its quality factor, \(K\) its stiffness and \(\omega_r\) its frequency.
Second equation: definition of the impedance written in the Fourier domain, and \(Z\) has the form
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:impedance_cylinder}
	Z(\omega) = Z_c \sum_n \frac{C_n}{j\omega - s_n}
\end{equation}
where \(Z_c\) represents the characteristic impedance \(Z_c = \frac{\rho c_0}{\pi R^2}\).

Last equation is the description of the valve effect obtained through Bernoulli's equation, where \(w\) is the reed width, \(h^+(t)= \max(h(t), 0)\) (so that \(w h^+(t)\) represents the opening section when $h(t) \ge 0$) and $\rho$ is the air density. According to sections \ref{sec:openingAtRest} and \ref{subsec:beatingPressure} we have $H \approx 0.3mm$ and $P_{br} \approx 4500 Pa$.

Because of the potential change in the flow direction which happens when $H$ grows, the last equation must be regularised along the lines of \cite{matteoli_minimal_2021}, by replacing the square root:
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:regularization}
	 \mathrm{sgn}(p_m-p)\sqrt{|p_m-p|} \longrightarrow \frac{p_m-p}{\sqrt[4]{(p_m-p)^2+\varepsilon P_{br}^2}}
\end{equation}
where  $\varepsilon$ is a small dimensionless parameter, taken for the simulations to be $10^{-6}$.
